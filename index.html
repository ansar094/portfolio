	<div class="about">
		<p>As a civil engineer with experience from both internship and full-time positions, I have developed skills in AutoCAD and Microsoft Office.
			During my internship, I gained exposure to a wide range of construction activities and developed a strong interest in construction and project management.<br>

In my previous role as an estimation engineer at NAFFCO Flow Control FZCO, I specialized in fireproofing and fire stopping, where I built a solid foundation in cost estimation, resource management, and material procurement.
			I also had the opportunity to assist in project coordination, which has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of project management, including scheduling, progress tracking, and team coordination.<br>

As a planning engineer, I am confident that I can leverage my experience and skills in Revit, AutoCAD, and Microsoft Office to ensure the efficient and timely completion of construction projects.
			I am proficient in using software tools such as Primavera P6 and Microsoft Project, and I have a proven track record of delivering projects on time and within budget.<br>

I have over three years of experience in cost estimation, quantity surveying, and budgeting, specializing in building renovations, refurbishments, fit-outs, pool construction, and landscaping.
			I excel at delivering accurate Bills of Quantities (BOQs), conducting material assessments, and providing cost-effective solutions while ensuring compliance with project standards and regulations. Additionally, I am skilled in using AutoCAD, PlanSwift, and Excel to control costs and enhance project efficiency.</p>
